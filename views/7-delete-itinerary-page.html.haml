      ## Exercise 1: Delete an Itinerary

    %pre.goal
      :preserve
        When I view an itinerary
        Then I should see a button to delete the itinerary
        When I click the delete button
        Then I should see that the itinerary has been deleted

        ### Issue 1: No delete button

            When I view an itinerary
            Then I should see a button to delete the itinerary
            But I see none

        #### Solution: Add form to delete the itinerary

            # app/views/itineraries/show.html.erb
            <%= form_for(@itinerary, method: :delete) do |f| %>
              <p>
                <%= f.submit, value: 'Delete Itinerary' %>
              </p>
            <% end %>

        ### Issue 2: Unknown destroy action

            When I click the delete button
            Then I should be informed that the itinerary has been deleted
            But instead I see
              Unknown action
              The action 'destroy' could not be found for ItinerariesController

        #### Solution: Add destroy action to ItinerariesController

            # app/controllers/itineraries_controller.rb
            class ItinerariesController < ApplicationController
              def destroy
              end
            end

        ### Issue 3: Missing destroy template

            When I click the delete button
            Then I should be informed that the itinerary has been deleted
            But instead I see
              Template is missing: Missing template itineraries/destroy, application/destroy with
              { :locale=>[:en],
                :formats=>[:html],
                :handlers=>[:erb, :builder, :raw, :ruby, :jbuilder, :coffee]}.
              Searched in: * "C:/Users/George Mendoza/trips-app/app/views"

        #### Solution: Destroy the itinerary, then show the list of itineraries

            # app/controllers/itineraries_controller.rb
            class ItinerariesController < ApplicationController
              def destroy
                @itinerary = Itinerary.find(params[:id])
                @itinerary.destroy
                redirect_to action: index
              end
            end

      ## Exercise 2: Notify me when the itinerary is deleted

    %pre.goal
      :preserve
          When I view an itinerary
          Then I should see a button to delete the itinerary
          When I click the delete button
          Then I should see that the itinerary has been deleted
          And I should be informed that it has been deleted

        ## Issue 4: I'm not informed if the itinerary is delete

            When I click the delete button
            Then I should see that the itinerary has been deleted
            And I should be informed that it has been deleted
            But I am not

        #### Solution: Try adding a notice to the index page

            # app/views/itineraries/index.html.erb
            <strong>Notice: <%= @notice %></strong>

            # app/controllers/itineraries_controller.rb
            def destroy
              @itinerary = Itinerary.find(params[:id])
              @itinerary.destroy
              @notice = "You have successfully deleted a itinerary"
              redirect_to action: 'index'
            end

        ### Issue: Nope, still not informed

            When I click the delete button
            And I should be informed that it has been deleted
            But instead I am STILL not informed that it has been deleted

        #### Solution: Change the notice to a flash message

            # app/views/itineraries/index.html.erb
            <strong>Notice: <%= flash[:notice] %></strong>

            # app/controllers/itineraries_controller.rb
            def destroy
              @itinerary = Itinerary.find(params[:id])
              @itinerary.destroy
              flash[:notice] = "You have successfully deleted a itinerary"
              redirect_to action: 'index'
            end
